These are files that differ from one system to another.
This repo is designed to be used as a submodule
of the repo `git@github.com:ofiscal/tax.co.web.git`.

The `master` branch of this repo can be customized --
indeed, it is useless until you do --
by editing the `base_system` portion of the file `paths.json`
to correspond to the system on which it is being run.
(Leave the `docker` portion of that file unchanged.)
